## Configuration

### Environment Variables (Frontend)
Create a `.env` file in the smartacademy directory:
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
VITE_PDF_MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760
VITE_PDF_ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS=.pdf
```

### Backend Configuration
The backend should already be configured with:
- Supabase storage bucket settings
- CORS enabled for frontend domain
- PDF upload routes at `/pdf/upload`, `/pdf/list`, etc.

## File Validation Rules

- **File Type**: Only PDF files (.pdf extension)
- **File Size**: Maximum 10MB per file

## Error Handling

The interface includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Invalid file types (non-PDF files)
- Files exceeding size limits

- File upload failures

## Next Steps

To start using the PDF upload interface:

1. **Start the Backend**: Ensure the FastAPI backend is running on port 8000

3. **Access Admin Dashboard**: Log in with admin credentials
4. **Navigate to PDF Management**: Click the new "PDF Management" tab
5. **Upload Your First PDF**: Use the drag & drop interface to upload a PDF file

The interface is now fully integrated and ready for use! The PDF upload functionality works with the existing backend API and maintains the app's design theme throughout.
